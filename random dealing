Everyone submits a random number.
their ID is the hash of their random number.
grouprandom = hash(everyone's ID, sorted from least to greatest)
localRandom=hash(groupRandom + my ID)




cards[i]=hash(localRandom + myRandom[i]) % deckLength

submit merkle tree of cards[0...n]


in order to prove that I really have cards[i], I have to provide myRandom[i], then others can verify that cards[i]=hash(localRandom + myRandom[i]) % deckLength
