Everyone submits a random number.
their ID is the hash of their random number.
grouprandom = hash(everyone's ID, sorted from least to greatest)
localRandom=hash(groupRandom + my ID)

whoCanDraw(cardIndex)=hash(cardIndex + groupRandom) % numPlayers
Now every player has a list of cards that they could draw


myRandom[i] is selected randomly, doesn't matter
cards[i]=hash(localRandom + myRandom[i] + i) % myDeckLength

submit merkle tree of cards[0...n] as my hand's hash


in order to prove that I really have cards[i], I have to provide myRandom[i], then others can verify that they calculated cards[i] correctly
